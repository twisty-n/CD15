 * Project Name:    CD15 Compiler
 * Description:     A compiler for the CD15 Programming Language

 BUG FIXES:
    - someArray[0] reports TUNDF instead of INTLIT
    - Starting program with a comment evals to error
    - No newline at end of file causes final lexeme to be reported as TUNDF

NOTE:
    - Scanner error semantics have no been repaired, since it will create an error anyway
    - Parser will try to recover to a statement level where it can, and a lower level in some cases
    - It will sometimes skip over optional parts of source code so that it can maintain its context
    - A fuzzy text match algorithm attempts to help when decided in token skipping behaviour

IMPORTANT:
    - If using batch mode. Ensure the files are only files containing CD15 source code
    - .cd15 !!

 Compiled and tested with Java 7 on Windows and OS X

 To run the compiler in SINGLE FILE MODE:
    java CD15 file your_input_file

To run the compiler in BATCH COMPILE MODE
    java CD15 folder path_to_all_my_CD15_files

To ACCESS HELP
    java cd15 help

The output will be a compilation listing and an AST file. Instructions for use can be
accessed with java cd15 help.

Tool to read listing file is utils/index.html
You then use the JS file picked launched by the button to select the my_file_name.ast.txt file
The tree will be graphically generated on the web page

You can use this tool to view individual files only

Listing files will also be generated in the directory that the compiler was run.
To view expanded debugging information, view the created debug.txt or the generated files for each source file

Note that the compiler will print any fatal error information to console.
