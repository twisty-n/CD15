 * Description:     A compiler for the CD15 Programming Language
 */


 Compiled and tested with Java 7 on Windows and OS X

 To run the compiler:
    java CD15 you_input_file

Note that the compiler can accept multiple files for compilation at once with
    java CD15 your_input_file_1 your_input_file_2 ...

The output will be the required Token stream specified in the Assignment 1 Brief,
as well as a listing file with all of the errors aggregated at the bottom of the file.

Listing files will also be generated in the directory that the compiler was run.
To view expanded debugging information, view the created debug.txt file

Note that the compiler will print any fatal error information to console.
